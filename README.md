# Anilist to MAL

Anilist to MAL is a simple python tool that lets you export your anime list from [AniList](https://anilist.co) to [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net).

## Usage

This app requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Python Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).

Install Python Requests with `pip3 install requests`.

Once both are installed, run the app with `python3 main.py` and follow the instructions!
